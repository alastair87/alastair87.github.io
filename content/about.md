Welcome! I'm a researcher, analyst, and framework developer exploring complex problems through systematic thinking.

## What I Do

This site documents my work across three main areas:

**Pathfinder** - Building a one-person think tank focused on independent research, policy analysis, and strategic thinking about contemporary issues.

**Film & TV** - Analytical essays on media, from deep dives into individual works to structural analysis of the entertainment industry.

**Frameworks** - Original conceptual frameworks for understanding complex problems, along with practical applications and methodology discussions.

## Approach

My work combines rigorous analysis with clear communication, aiming to make complex ideas accessible while maintaining intellectual depth. I believe in the power of good frameworks to illuminate patterns and enable better decision-making.

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration, have questions about my work, or want to discuss ideas.
