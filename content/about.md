Abacus Writes engages in research, analysis, and critique across culture, technology, and society.

The writing is intended to exist in the spirit of [Diogenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes) (I walk around a lot and I don't get paid!) and the philosophy of [Cynicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism) -  hence no comments or other social feedback, and no advertising.
